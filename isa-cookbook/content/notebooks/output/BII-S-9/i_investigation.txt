Study Protocol Description	Waters samples were prefiltered through a 1.6 um GF/A glass fibre filter to reduce Eukaryotic contamination. Filtrate was then collected on a 0.2 um Sterivex (millipore) filter which was frozen in liquid nitrogen until nucelic acid extraction. CO2 bubbled through 11000 L mesocosm to simulate ocean acidification predicted conditions. Then phosphate and nitrate were added to induce a phytoplankton bloom.	Total nucleic acid extraction was done as quickly as possible using the method of Neufeld et al, 2007.	splitting collected samples into aliquots	superscript+random hexamer primer			1. Sample Input and Fragmentation: The Genome Sequencer FLX System supports the sequencing of samples from a wide variety of starting materials including genomic DNA, PCR products, BACs, and cDNA. Samples such as genomic DNA and BACs are fractionated into small, 300- to 800-base pair fragments. For smaller samples, such as small non-coding RNA or PCR amplicons, fragmentation is not required. Instead, short PCR products amplified using Genome Sequencer fusion primers can be used for immobilization onto DNA capture beads as shown below.
